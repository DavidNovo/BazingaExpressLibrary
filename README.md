# The Bazinga Library Project

## Introduction to the Project

## Setting up the Project
 install dependencies:
     $ npm install

## Running the Project
To run the project in a production environment
   run the app:
     `$ DEBUG=bazingaexpresslibrary:* npm start`

To run the project in a development environment
     `$ DEBUG=express-locallibrary-tutorial:* npm run devstart`

Note, when scripts other than 'start' are created running them means we have
to call "npm run <scriptname>", not just "npm <scriptname>" because "start"
is an NPM command mapped to the named script.
