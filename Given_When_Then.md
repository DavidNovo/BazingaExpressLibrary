# User Stories for the Library
## Format of the User Stories
For this project, the first design document will be the 
User Stories that will be solved by the system.

A User Story solves this question: Who does What by When. The Who part is usually
clear.  The Who can be a person or the system itself.  In many cases the Who is 
also called the User.  

The What is often less clear.  What needs to be done?  What does the User want to accomplish.
This will vary depending on who the user is.

The When is often forgotten, but is important.  If the Who is a human, then the when is often
'as soon as possible'.  But what does this mean?  How much time can the user be
expected to wait?  If the Who is the System, what will tell the system to act?

Another way to think of a user story is this:
As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.

The Given-When-Then formula is a template intended to guide the writing 
of acceptance tests for a User Story:

(Given) some context
(When) some action is carried out
(Then) a particular set of observable consequences should obtain
